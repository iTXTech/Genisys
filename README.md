Introduction
-------------
Genisys is a server software based on **[PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP)** with extended functionality. Most of the original code was written by **PocketMine Team**.<br>
Some of the extended functionality that Genisys offers:

* Extended API for plugins (GeniAPI)
* Synapse Client support
* Optional Xbox Live authentication
* Support for Windows 10 Edition Beta

However, Genisys still has a long way to go. We welcome contributions.
